abstract = "This paper focuses on methods of constructing of reduced-order models of mechanical systems which preserve the Lagrangian structure of the original system. These methods may be used in combination with standard spatial decomposition methods, such as the Karhunen–Loève expansion, balancing, and wavelet decompositions. The model reduction procedure is implemented for three-dimensional finite-element models of elasticity, and we show that using the standard Newmark implicit integrator, significant savings are obtained in the computational costs of simulation. In particular simulation of the reduced model scales linearly in the number of degrees of freedom, and parallelizes well."

abstract="Many reduced-order models are neither robust with respect to parameter changes nor cost-effective enough for handling the nonlinear dependence of complex dynamical systems. In this study, we put forth a robust machine learning framework for projection-based reduced-order modeling of such nonlinear and nonstationary systems. As a demonstration, we focus on a nonlinear advection-diffusion system given by the viscous Burgers equation, which is a prototypical setting of more realistic fluid dynamics applications due to its quadratic nonlinearity. In our proposed methodology the effects of truncated modes are modeled using a single layer feed-forward neural network architecture. The neural network architecture is trained by utilizing both the Bayesian regularization and extreme learning machine approaches, where the latter one is found to be more computationally efficient. A significant emphasis is laid on the selection of basis functions through the use of both Fourier bases and proper orthogonal decomposition. It is shown that the proposed model yields significant improvements in accuracy over the standard Galerkin projection methodology with a negligibly small computational overhead and provide reliable predictions with respect to parameter changes.",

      abstract = {Closure modeling based on the Mori-Zwanzig formalism has  proven effective to improve the stability and accuracy of  projection-based model order reduction. However, closure  models are often expensive and infeasible for complex  nonlinear systems. Towards efficient model reduction of  general problems, this paper presents a recurrent neural  network (RNN) closure of parametric POD-Galerkin  reduced-order model. Based on the short time history of the  reduced-order solutions, the RNN predicts the memory  integral which represents the impact of the unresolved  scales on the resolved scales. A conditioned long short  term memory (LSTM) network is utilized as the regression  model of the memory integral, in which the POD coefficients  at a number of time steps are fed into the LSTM units, and  the physical/geometrical parameters are fed into the  initial hidden state of the LSTM. The reduced-order model  is integrated in time using an implicit-explicit (IMEX)  Runge-Kutta scheme, in which the memory term is integrated  explicitly and the remaining right-hand-side term is  integrated implicitly to improve the computational  efficiency. Numerical results demonstrate that the RNN  closure can significantly improve the accuracy and  efficiency of the POD-Galerkin reduced-order model of  nonlinear problems. The POD-Galerkin reduced-order model  with the RNN closure is also shown to be capable of making  accurate predictions, well beyond the time interval of the  training data.},

The operation count for the on-line stage in which, given a new parameter value, we calculate the output of interest and associated error bound, depends only on N (typically very small) and the parametric complexity of the problem; the method is thus ideally suited for the repeated and rapid evaluations required in the context of parameter estimation, design, optimization, and real-time control. }",

We extend a discontinuous finite element discretization originally considered for hyperbolic systems such as the Euler equations to the case of the Navier–Stokes equations by treating the viscous terms with a mixed formulation. The method combines two key ideas which are at the basis of the finite volume and of the finite element method, the physics of wave propagation being accounted for by means of Riemann problems and accuracy being obtained by means of high-order polynomial approximations within elements. As a consequence the method is ideally suited to compute high-order accurate solution of the Navier–Stokes equations on unstructured grids. The performance of the proposed method is illustrated by computing the compressible viscous flow on a flat plate and around a NACA0012 airfoil for several flow regimes using constant, linear, quadratic, and cubic elements."

Résumé
Nous considérons une formulation variationnelle espace–temps pour les équations différentielles paraboliques linéaires. Nous y associons une discrétisation par éléments finis de Petrov–Galerkin pour laquelle la constante de stabilité inf-sup βδ possède des propriétés agréables : βδ est unité pour lʼéquation de la chaleur ; βδ a une croissance seulement linéaire en temps pour des opérateurs de convection non-coercifs (mais asymptotiquement stables).

abstract = "Jacobian-free Newton–Krylov (JFNK) methods are synergistic combinations of Newton-type methods for superlinearly convergent solution of nonlinear equations and Krylov subspace methods for solving the Newton correction equations. The link between the two methods is the Jacobian-vector product, which may be probed approximately without forming and storing the elements of the true Jacobian, through a variety of means. Various approximations to the Jacobian matrix may still be required for preconditioning the resulting Krylov iteration. As with Krylov methods for linear problems, successful application of the JFNK method to any given problem is dependent on adequate preconditioning. JFNK has potential for application throughout problems governed by nonlinear partial differential equations and integro-differential equations. In this survey paper, we place JFNK in context with other nonlinear solution algorithms for both boundary value problems (BVPs) and initial value problems (IVPs). We provide an overview of the mechanics of JFNK and attempt to illustrate the wide variety of preconditioning options available. It is emphasized that JFNK can be wrapped (as an accelerator) around another nonlinear fixed point method (interpreted as a preconditioning process, potentially with significant code reuse). The aim of this paper is not to trace fully the evolution of JFNK, nor to provide proofs of accuracy or optimal convergence for all of the constituent methods, but rather to present the reader with a perspective on how JFNK may be applicable to applications of interest and to provide sources of further practical information."

abstract = "Multistep methods are classically constructed by specially designed difference operators on an equidistant time grid. To make them practically useful, they have to be implemented by varying the step-size according to some error-control algorithm. It is well known how to extend Adams and BDF formulas to a variable step-size formulation. In this paper we present a collocation approach to construct variable step-size formulas. We make use of piecewise polynomials to show that every k-step method of order k+1 has a variable step-size polynomial collocation formulation."
