\subsection{\methodAcronym\ summary}
This section outlined the \methodAcronym\ \approachKwd\ for model reduction. In
summary, \methodAcronym\ sequentially minimizes the time continuous FOM ODE
residual within the range of a space--time trial subspace over time
windows; i.e.,  
\methodAcronym\ sequentially computes approximate solutions
$\approxstateArgnt{n}\in\stspace^n$, $n=1,\ldots,\nslabs$ that comprise
solutions to the optimization problem \eqref{eq:tclsrm}.
For \spatialAcronym\ trial subspaces, the stationary conditions for the
residual minimization problem can be derived via the Euler--Lagrange equations
and yield the system \eqref{eq:lspg_continuous}--\eqref{eq:lspg_bcs} over the $n$th window for $t \in
[\timeStartArg{n},\timeEndArg{n}]$.
\methodAcronym\ with \spatialAcronym\ trial subspaces can be alternatively interpreted as a Lagrange problem from optimal control: the Galerkin method is forced by a 
controller that enforces the residual minimization property. 
Section~\ref{sec:wls_spacetime} additionally considered \spaceTimeAcronym\
trial subspaces. For \spaceTimeAcronym\ trial subspaces, in where the
generalized coordinates are no longer functions, the stationary conditions
correspond to the system of algebraic equations \eqref{eq:st_stationary}.
