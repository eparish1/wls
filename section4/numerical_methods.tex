\section{Numerical Solution Techniques}\label{sec:numerical_techniques}
The discussion to this point has outlined the formulation of the \methodAcronym\ method. We now consider numerical solution techniques. 
As \methodAcronym\ displays commonalities with optimal control problems, a large existing body of work can be leveraged. This section discuses a variety of such techniques and outlines how they can be used to solve the \methodAcronym\ system. We focus primarily on direct and indirect methods for \spatialAcronym\ trial spaces, 
and then briefly outline direct and indirect methods for \spaceTimeAcronym\ trial spaces. 
%Equation~\ref{eq:obj_gen_slab} displays commonalities with optimal control problems. For timeslabs $n = 1,\ldots,\nslabs$, the objective is to find the \textit{function} $\genstate^n(t)$ that minimizes the \textit{functional} $ \mathcal{J}^n$. The distinction between Eq.~\ref{eq:obj_gen_slab} and traditional optimal control problems is that, in the form presented in Eq.~\ref{eq:obj_gen_slab}, (1) there is not a controller and (2) there is no system that describes the dynamics for the generalized coordinates. 
%Techniques used to solve optimal control problems can be leveraged to solve Eq.~\ref{eq:obj_gen_slab} (or, equivalently, Eqs.~\eqref{eq:tclspg_oc1} and~\eqref{eq:tclspg_oc2}).

\subsection{\spatialAcronym: Direct and Indirect Methods}
Numerical techniques to
solve optimal control problems can be classified as either
\textit{direct} or \textit{indirect}
methods~\cite{conway_optimalcontrolreview}. Direct method eschew the calculus of variations 
and attempt to ``directly" solve the optimization problem~\eqref{eq:tclsrm} by first
numerically discretizing the system and objective functional and ``transcribing"
the infinite dimensional problem into a finite-dimensional nonlinear
programming (optimization) problem. Direct approaches thus ``discretize then optimize."
Indirect methods, on the other hand, leverage the calculus of variations to
derive the Euler--Lagrange equations, which comprise the first-order optimality conditions~\eqref{eq:lspg_continuous}-\eqref{eq:lspg_bcs} associated with the objective 
functional. Indirect methods then solve (numerically) the Euler--Lagrange equations. Thus, indirect methods ``optimize then discretize," and 
solve the optimization problem
``indirectly". For both direct and indirect methods, a variety of
discretization/solution approaches are then possible. Collocation methods,
finite elements, spectral methods, shooting methods, etc., are all examples of
plausible solution techniques.  

In the present context, both direct and indirect methods are investigated to solve \methodAcronym\ with \spatialAcronym\ trial spaces. We consider: 

\begin{itemize} \item Discretize then Optimize (Direct Methods): 
\begin{itemize}
\item Discretize and then optimize approaches are outlined for linear multistep methods. 
\end{itemize} 
\item Optimize then Discretize (Indirect Methods): 
\begin{itemize} 
\item An indirect method leveraging the forward-backward sweep algorithm is outlined 
to solve~\eqref{eq:lspg_continuous}-\eqref{eq:lspg_bcs}. 
 \end{itemize} 
\end{itemize} 
It
is emphasized that a variety of other approaches exist. A detailed exploration
of additional approaches will be a subject of future work. Section~\ref{sec:direct} 
will outline direct solution approaches based on linear multistep methods, 
while Section~\ref{sec:indirect} will outline the indirect solution approach.
