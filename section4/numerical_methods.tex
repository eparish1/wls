\section{Numerical solution techniques}\label{sec:numerical_techniques}
The discussion to this point has outlined the formulation of the \methodAcronym\ method. We now consider numerical solution techniques. 
\EP{I think passive voice is fine in this instance, it reads easier}
As \methodAcronym\ displays commonalities with optimal
control problems, a large existing body of work can be leveraged. This section
discuses a variety of such techniques and outlines how they can be used to
solve the \methodAcronym\ system. We focus primarily on 
%\KTC{earlier we kept

%direct (i.e.,
%	discretize-then-optimize) and indirect (i.e., optimize-then-discretize).
%	Let's be consistent when we re-introduce it here.}
direct (discretize-the-optimize) and indirect (optimize-then-discretize) for \spatialAcronym\ trial subspaces, 
and then briefly outline direct and indirect methods for \spaceTimeAcronym\ trial subspaces. 

\subsection{\spatialAcronym: direct and indirect methods}
Numerical techniques to
solve optimal control problems can be classified as either
\textit{direct} or \textit{indirect}
methods~\cite{conway_optimalcontrolreview}.  Direct methods eschew the first order optimality conditions
~\eqref{eq:lspg_continuous}--\eqref{eq:lspg_bcs} and, instead, ``directly" solve the optimization problem~\eqref{eq:tclsrm} by first
numerically discretizing the system and objective functional and ``transcribing"
the infinite dimensional problem into a finite-dimensional nonlinear
programming (optimization) problem. Direct approaches thus ``discretize then optimize."
Indirect methods, on the other hand, leverage the calculus of variations to
derive the Euler--Lagrange equations, which comprise the first-order
optimality conditions~\eqref{eq:lspg_continuous}--\eqref{eq:lspg_bcs} associated with the objective 
functional. Indirect methods then solve (numerically) the Euler--Lagrange equations. Thus, indirect methods ``optimize then discretize," and 
solve the optimization problem
``indirectly". A variety of discretization/solution techniques are possible for both direct and indirect methods. Collocation methods,
finite elements, spectral methods, shooting methods, etc., are all examples of
plausible solution techniques.  

In the present context, we investigate both direct and indirect methods to solve \methodAcronym\ with \spatialAcronym\ trial
subspaces. We consider: 
\begin{itemize} \item \textit{Direct Methods (discretize-then-optimize)}: Discretize and then optimize approaches are outlined for linear multistep methods. 
\item \textit{Indirect methods (optimize-then-discretize)}: An indirect method leveraging the forward-backward sweep algorithm is outlined 
to solve~\eqref{eq:lspg_continuous}-\eqref{eq:lspg_bcs}. 
\end{itemize} 
We emphasize that a variety of other approaches exist. Future work will comprise a detailed exploration
of additional approaches.
Section~\ref{sec:direct}  outlines direct solution approaches based on linear
multistep methods, while Section~\ref{sec:indirect} outlines the indirect
solution approach.
